# 🎓 Felicia Laster | Special Education & EdTech Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my **EdTech Project Portfolio**, a collection of four original applications built to enhance accessibility, progress monitoring, and educator empowerment.  
Each project demonstrates full-stack development skills, UX awareness, and a focus on real-world needs in **special education** and **inclusive learning design**.

## 🧩 Project 1: Interactive Lesson Planner
**Type:** Frontend Web Application | **Stack:** React, TailwindCSS, JavaScript  

**Description:**  
An intuitive, accessibility-focused web app that allows teachers to create, organize, and manage lesson plans tailored to students with individualized needs. Designed for clarity and ease of use, the planner integrates IEP goals, accommodations, and interactive scheduling — giving educators a streamlined digital workspace that mirrors how they actually plan.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive dashboard with calendar and quick stats  
- Dynamic lesson creation with IEP goal tagging  
- Reusable templates and editable fields  
- Print-ready and exportable lesson summaries  
- LocalStorage persistence (no backend required)  

**Technical Highlights:**  
Built with **React** for stateful interactivity and **TailwindCSS** for fast, accessible UI styling. The app emphasizes semantic HTML and ARIA labeling to support assistive technologies.

## 🗂️ Project 2: Student Data Manager
**Type:** Backend API | **Stack:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB  

**Description:**  
A secure backend system for teachers to manage student records, contact data, and academic information. The Student Data Manager acts as the foundation for any education-focused app requiring protected, scalable data handling — supporting authentication, validation, and RESTful API design.

**Key Features:**
- Teacher authentication using JWT  
- CRUD operations for student profiles  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Secure password hashing and session management  
- API ready for frontend integration  

**Technical Highlights:**  
Developed with **Node.js** and **Express**, with data stored in **MongoDB Atlas**. Implements **Helmet**, **CORS**, and **rate limiting** for enhanced API security. Perfect as the backend base for future full-stack builds.

## 📊 Project 3: Special Education Progress Tracker
**Type:** Full Stack Application | **Stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)  

**Description:**  
A comprehensive progress monitoring system that enables teachers to track, visualize, and report on student IEP goals. It bridges daily data collection with big-picture analysis, helping educators transform raw observations into meaningful insights for meetings and reports.

**Key Features:**
- Teacher dashboard summarizing student progress  
- Individual student pages with goal tracking  
- Chart-based data visualization using Chart.js  
- Progress logs, comments, and media attachments  
- Exportable reports for IEPs and parent conferences  

**Technical Highlights:**  
Full-stack MERN architecture with **JWT authentication**, **React Router** for client-side navigation, and **Chart.js/D3.js** for analytics. Focuses on usability and clarity for data-heavy workflows.

## 🌍 Project 4: Travel Journal for Educators
**Type:** Mobile App | **Stack:** React Native, Firebase, Google Maps API  

**Description:**  
A global travel journal built for teachers who bring the world into their classrooms. This mobile app lets educators capture travels, reflect on educational connections, and share location-tagged experiences with peers. It includes map-based visualization and tools for turning adventures into classroom resources.

**Key Features:**
- Photo and video journaling with geotagging  
- Map-based exploration of educator journeys  
- Offline entry creation and background sync  
- Classroom resource builder and Google Classroom export  
- QR code sharing for field trips and lessons  

**Technical Highlights:**  
Developed in **React Native** with **Firebase** as the backend (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions). Uses **Google Maps API** for location visualization and **Expo** for streamlined deployment to mobile devices.

## 💡 Why These Projects Matter
Each project serves a genuine educational purpose — from lesson design to data management to creative reflection.  
Together, they form an ecosystem that supports:
- **Teacher productivity**
- **Student equity**
- **Accessible design**
- **Evidence-based progress tracking**

They’re built not just as coding exercises, but as scalable prototypes for the future of **Special Education technology**.
